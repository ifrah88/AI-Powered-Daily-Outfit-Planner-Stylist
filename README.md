# AI-Powered-Daily-Outfit-Planner-Stylist
Developed an AI-powered Android app using Kotlin that suggests fashionably compatible outfits based on user wardrobe selections. The app features a clean UI for browsing, uploading, and saving clothing items. It uses a Fashion Compatibility Network (FCN) trained on the Polyvore outfit dataset, converted to TensorFlow Lite for real-time, offline recommendations. The model analyzes visual compatibility and displays the top 5 outfit suggestions using cosine similarity. Users can save their favorite combinations in the "My Wardrobe" section, view a summary of saved outfits, and rate each with a 5-star feedback system to refine future recommendations.
