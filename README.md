Developed a fashion compatibility Android app in Kotlin, using a TensorFlow Lite model based on a Fashion Compatibility Network (FCN) trained on the Polyvore dataset. The app provides real-time outfit recommendations, allowing users to browse, save, rate looks and check summary of saved outfits in a personalized My Wardrobe section.
